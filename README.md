BingoCardMaker
==============

This initial version has a model to represent the classic bingo game with numbers 1-75 arranged into columns of B-I-N-G-O.

When opening a new document the app will call bingo results in random order and print them in the document until all 75 possible bingo results have been called.

TODO is to handle the playing bingo cards.
